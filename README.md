# Implementation-of-polynomial-Linear-regression-using-python
This project's motivation was to predict the employee's salary based upon the level since our data is non-linear seperable we are using polynomial regression in this business problem


we are provided with the dataset (position_salaries.csv) in which we want to predict salary of a new employee , the employee has got his salary in his/her previous company based upon the level , the employee is telling that he/she got $12,000 in their previous company,we want to find whether the newly recruited employee is telling truth or not.
